- **Storage Cleanup**: Removes files from Contabo S3 bucket
- **Cost Optimization**: Prevents storage waste from unused images

---

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Frontend Changes (`edit-product-form.tsx`):**
```javascript
// New state management
const [currentImages, setCurrentImages] = useState<string[]>(product.images || []);
const [imagesToDelete, setImagesToDelete] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Delete functionality
const removeCurrentImage = (index: number) => {
    const imageToDelete = currentImages[index];
    setImagesToDelete(prev => [...prev, imageToDelete]);
    setCurrentImages(prev => prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
};

// Enhanced UI with delete buttons
<Button
    type="button"
    variant="destructive"
    size="sm"
    className="absolute -top-2 -right-2 h-6 w-6 rounded-full p-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity"
    onClick={() => removeCurrentImage(index)}
    title="Delete image"
>
    <X className="h-3 w-3" />
</Button>
```

### **Backend Changes (`productController.js`):**
```javascript
// Enhanced update logic
let updatedImages = [...existingProduct.images]; // Start with existing images

// Handle image deletions
if (req.body.imagesToDelete) {
    const imagesToDelete = JSON.parse(req.body.imagesToDelete);
    
    // Remove from array
    updatedImages = updatedImages.filter(img => !imagesToDelete.includes(img));
    
    // Delete from S3 storage
    for (const imageUrl of imagesToDelete) {
        const s3Key = contaboStorage.extractS3KeyFromUrl(imageUrl);
        if (s3Key) {
            await contaboStorage.deleteFile(s3Key);
        }
    }
}

// Add new images
if (req.uploadedFiles && req.uploadedFiles.length > 0) {
    const newImageUrls = req.uploadedFiles.map(f => f.url);
    updatedImages = [...updatedImages, ...newImageUrls];
}

updateData.images = updatedImages;
```

### **Storage Service Enhancement:**
```javascript
// New method for URL parsing
extractS3KeyFromUrl(url) {
    // Handles presigned URLs and proxy URLs
    // Extracts S3 key for deletion
    // Returns null for invalid URLs
}
```
