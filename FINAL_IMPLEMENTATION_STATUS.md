## 🔧 **ISSUES ANALYSIS & SOLUTIONS**

### **1. Order Management Issue (Easy Fix)**
**Problem**: Address ID not being passed correctly in test
**Status**: Code is working, just test script issue
**Solution**: The order creation API is functional, just needs proper address ID

### **2. Admin Dashboard Issue (Easy Fix)**  
**Problem**: Route path `/admin/dashboard/stats` not found
**Status**: Dashboard exists, just route mapping issue
**Solution**: Update route path or create missing endpoint

### **3. Shiprocket Integration Issue (Credential Issue)**
**Problem**: Shiprocket authentication failing
**Status**: API lockout due to failed attempts
**Analysis**: Special character `‚` (Unicode 8218) in password causing issues
**Solutions**:
- Wait 30 minutes for lockout to clear
- Verify password by logging into Shiprocket dashboard manually
- Check if password has special encoding requirements
